# Accessible Marketing Webpage Code Refactoring

## Description 

This code refactoring is a project commissioned by a marketing client to improve the accessibility of their webpage. I refactored the starter code and made the CSS style sheet more efficient by consolidating the CSS selectors and properties, and organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.


## Challenges

Some challenges I faced were:
- Getting the positioning of the sections accurate to the screenshot
- Committing changes to the GitHub repository
